- Tasks for today:
carried out evaluation on plots and am happy that LR is being evaluated suitably. it appears there
may just not be a good amount of data for the models using a larger learning rate, even though by
other evaluation standerds these models seem to produce the best results

    [x] - review learning rate results and plots,
    [x] - plot models between best and worse results
    [x] - get segmentation results from best model and last model
    [x] - look into custom compose function for transforms to tensor masks
    - start applying further transforms
    - PCA of Centroid location:

- random seed fixing needs to be validated but were not seeing perfect replication but this may be due 
  to zero workers beng used on the LAR server. keep an eye on this!
- LR seems to be fine from plots. need to evaluate best model and last model and compare results
- Example of understanding LR:

- Validate random seed modification recomended by andy
- Collate function need to be modified, not high on priorities list
- Validate modifications to config requires just training a model using it!
- Transforms currently only work on images and not transforms, Unsure why this is as it used 
  the same compose function as tutorials but this should be checked to see if IS issue and then
  fixed if so
- Further transforms, would be interesting, but not high on priority list? maybe
- Post segmentation processing, This would be a further step and potentially mirrored in a 
  New part of the pipeling focusing on  implementation
- Centroid Error needs to be given careful consideration not so much for implementation but for
  how this can be integrated into pipeline for evaluation
