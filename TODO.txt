Tasks:
[] - Validate randoms seed fixing
[] - Modify collate_fn
[] - Validate modifications to config
[] - Customise compose function for transforms
[] - Further Transforms
[] - Post Segmentation Processing
[] - Centroid Error
[] - Improve Logging 
[] - Optimise how things are working

Notes:
- Validate random seed modification recomended by andy
- Collate function need to be modified, not high on priorities list
- Validate modifications to config requires just training a model using it!
- Transforms currently only work on images and not transforms, Unsure why this is as it used 
  the same compose function as tutorials but this should be checked to see if IS issue and then
  fixed if so
- Further transforms, would be interesting, but not high on priority list? maybe
- Post segmentation processing, This would be a further step and potentially mirrored in a 
  New part of the pipeling focusing on  implementation
- Centroid Error needs to be given careful consideration not so much for implementation but for
  how this can be integrated into pipeline for evaluation
